# HostelCare
Hostel Care is a web application that facilitates the submission, tracking, and resolution of concerns raised by hostel residents. The system provides a user-friendly interface for residents to report issues and for administrators to efficiently manage and resolve them. It allows the following:
- Students can log their complaints and track their status
- Wardens are able to manage all the complaints in one place, effectively.
- Additionally, for security purposes, it uses a role-based control access.
